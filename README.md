# INFO7390 - Yelp Business Success Prediction

# Problem Statement
The challenge lies in leveraging Yelp data to gain insights into factors that contribute to the success of restaurants and predicting the success of new or existing restaurants based on various features and attributes.

# Pre-requisites
We ensure that we have the following requirements on the machine
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

# Project Overview
This project utilizes Yelp's extensive dataset to explore factors that influence the success of businesses. We aimed to develop a predictive model that can forecast the potential success of new and existing businesses based on various attributes available in the data. This model serves to aid business owners, investors, and analysts in making informed decisions.
